# ta-extend
## extensions for textadept languages by [Alejandro Baez][1]

### DESCRIPTION
After using [Textadept][2] for a while, you tend to build your own extensions
to languages, [among][3] [other][4] [things][5].
The normal form of extending languages in textadept is usually making a
*post_init.lua* file in a [language modules][6]. However, the procedure
can become quite a large set of language modules. Instead, this module
allows you to extend textadept languages without making a whole new module
in the process
